# RChain Co-op Processes in Rholang

## Overview
This project explores the use of Rholang as a language for expressing business processes. In particular, the business processes of the RChain Cooperative. If you're new to RChain, see the FAQ (below).

## The Benefit to the Co-op
* Improve communication and transparency of co-op processes
* Establish collaborative environment for discussing and effecting co-op processes
* Proof of concept of RChain for human processes
* Improve co-op processes
* Improve RChain and Rholang by exercising its capabilities
* To execute and automate co-op processes
* Ultimately, contribute to the platform co-op

## Why use Rholang to Express RChain Co-op Processes?

### Fitness of Computational Model
Rholang is based on message passing. Human processes involve either sending a message or receiving a message, i.e., submitting a statement of work, approving an invoice, casting a vote, etc.

### Formal Language
It's debatable if formal languages are better for expressing human processes. In this project both formal and natural languages will be used. The goal is not to make robots of co-op members, but to take advantage of the rigor required in expressing processes in a computable language to improve the processes themselves and the shared understanding of them. 

### Demonstrate the RChain System
The RChain compute platform is described as a coordination technology. It can support token economic systems which coordinate human activity through traditional financial incentives as well as a general purpose computing system. It's focus on the interaction between named things should make it well suited to modeling the interactions between participants involved in co-op processes. This project tries to justify that hypothesis.

## FAQ
**What is RChain?**

RChain is a blockchain computer, a virtual computer distributed across a global network of nodes each running the RChain protocol. These nodes come to consensus through economic incentives to agree on the execution of the programs running on the platform. See https://rchain.coop

**What is Rholang?**

Rholang is a general purpose computer language used for writing programs (often called 'smart contracts') which run on the RChain blockchain computer. Rholang is different from most programming languages in that the fundamental action a Rholang program makes is the sending or receiving of a message, whereas most programming languages which assume a Von Neumann architecture, consist of operations which read or alter the state of memory. See https://github.com/rchain/rchain/tree/master/rholang

**What do you mean by process?**

A process is a series of steps or actions but, because of the message passing nature of Rholang, we can focus on the communication amongst process participants. The goal of this project is less one of automating processes, but of communicating participant rights and obligations in terms of accepted communications. In this project we think of processes in terms of who can say what and when? Who can or must respond and in what ways? 

**What processes have been designed?**



**How can I contribute?**

* File tickets to discuss the design of co-op processes
* Write Rholang for co-op processes
* Build supporting infrastructure to connect the Rholang processes with the outside (off-chain) world.

**How can I see what's been done on the project so far?**

Two ways:
* GitHub history of check-ins
* RHours reports
